## ü™Å Project #1 
Deriving functions to accurately model datasets is no easy feat. 
* This [python algorithm](/polynomials.py) computes the most accurate polynomial obtainable for a given dataset.
* The x and y coordinates are provided in column format on a excel sheet.
* The desired polynomial degree is given as an input (with a maximum degree of 7).
* It uses the substitution of `n + 1` corrdinates, where `n = degree`.
* The algorithm returns the optimal set of coordinates for manual derivation of the function. 
* Note: this code is a work in progress.
